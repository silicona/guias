# RegExp

Beware your steps...

`You can't parse [X]HTML with regex. Because HTML can't be parsed by regex. Regex is not a tool that can be used to correctly parse HTML. As I have answered in HTML-and-regex questions here so many times before, the use of regex will not allow you to consume HTML. Regular expressions are a tool that is insufficiently sophisticated to understand the constructs employed by HTML. HTML is not a regular language and hence cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Regex queries are not equipped to break down HTML into its meaningful parts. so many times but it is not getting to me. Even enhanced irregular regular expressions as used by Perl are not up to the task of parsing HTML. You will never make me crack. HTML is a language of sufficient complexity that it cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Even Jon Skeet cannot parse HTML using regular expressions. Every time you attempt to parse HTML with regular expressions, the unholy child weeps the blood of virgins, and Russian hackers pwn your webapp. Parsing HTML with regex summons tainted souls into the realm of the living. HTML and regex go together like love, marriage, and ritual infanticide. The <center> cannot hold it is too late. The force of regex and HTML together in the same conceptual space will destroy your mind like so much watery putty. If you parse HTML with regex you are giving in to Them and their blasphemous ways which doom us all to inhuman toil for the One whose Name cannot be expressed in the Basic Multilingual Plane, he comes. HTML-plus-regexp will liquify the n​erves of the sentient whilst you observe, your psyche withering in the onslaught of horror.

Have you tried using an XML parser instead?

## Sintaxis de Exp Reg

[Cheatsheet](cheat-regexp.pdf)

## Sublime Text

### Expresión multilinea

Ejemplo a captar:

***

`<IfModule mod_setenvif.c>
    <IfModule mod_headers.c>
        <FilesMatch "\.(bmp|cur|gif|ico|jpe?g|png|svgz?|webp)$">
            SetEnvIf Origin ":" IS_CORS
            Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*" env=IS_CORS
        </FilesMatch>
    </IfModule>
</IfModule>`

***

Expresión que la capta:

	(<IfModule.*((?!</IfModule>\n\n).|\n)+</IfModule>)

Sustitución con comillas para convertirlo en código md:

	`$1`


Expresion para solo un IfModule:

	(<IfModule.*((?!</IfModule>).|\n)+</IfModule>)

## Lookahead
La regexp observa lo que sigue del grupo a capturar:
  : Positiva - `/q(?=u)/` sobre quit captura 'q'
  : Negativa - `/q(?!u)/` sobre quit NO captura 'q'

## Lookbehind
La regexp observa lo que antecede al grupo a capturar:
  : Positiva - `/(?<=a)b/`sobre cab captura 'b'
  : Negativa - `/(?<!a)b/` sobre cab NO captura 'b'
